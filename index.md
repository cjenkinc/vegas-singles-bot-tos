Last Updated: February 25, 2025

Welcome to Vegas Singles Bot! These Terms of Service (ToS) govern your use of our Discord bot designed to help singles connect in a fun, Vegas-style way. By inviting or using the bot, you agree to follow these rules. If you don’t agree, please don’t use the bot.

## 1. Acceptance of Terms
- Using Vegas Singles Bot means you accept these terms and our [Privacy Policy](https://cjenkinc.github.io/vegas-singles-bot-privacy-policy/).
- You must also follow Discord’s [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines), since we operate on their platform.

## 2. Eligibility
- You must be at least 13 years old (or the legal age of consent in your region) to use Vegas Singles Bot.
- This bot is for singles looking to connect—don’t use it if that’s not your vibe.

## 3. How to Use the Bot
- **Purpose**: Vegas Singles Bot helps singles chat, match, or flirt through commands in Discord servers.
- **Commands**: We log your user ID, username, and commands you run to keep things running smoothly (see our Privacy Policy for details).
- **Behavior**: Play nice—no spam, harassment, or abuse of the bot. We’re here for fun, not drama.

## 4. Your Responsibilities
- You’re responsible for what you say or do through the bot. Keep it legal and respectful.
- Don’t try to break, hack, or misuse the bot—it’s not cool, and we’ll kick you out.

## 5. Our Rights
- We can update, tweak, or shut down the bot anytime without notice. It’s our baby, after all.
- If you break these terms, we can block you from using Vegas Singles Bot—no refunds on the free fun you’ve had.

## 6. No Warranties
- The bot’s provided “as is.” We try to keep it running, but no promises it’ll be perfect or always available.
- If it glitches or goes offline, we’re not liable for any heartbreak or missed connections.

## 7. Limitation of Liability
- We’re not responsible for any issues caused by using the bot—like if someone ghosts you after a match. Vegas Singles Bot is just the wingman, not the relationship guru.
- If something goes wrong, our liability is capped at nothing (it’s a free bot!).

## 8. Changes to These Terms
- We might update these terms as the bot evolves. Check back here for the latest. If there’s a big change, we’ll try to ping you via the bot or our community.
- Keep using the bot after changes, and you’re agreeing to the new terms.

## 9. Contact Us
- Got questions or issues? Reach out on Discord at `supernova1313`. Let’s sort it out over a virtual Vegas cocktail.

## 10. Termination
- You can stop using the bot anytime—just kick it from your server or ignore it.
- We can terminate your access if you break these rules or if we decide to retire the bot.
